This project is a full-stack Spotify clone built using React and the Context API. The app is designed to provide a seamless listening experience for music enthusiasts by closely emulating the Spotify interface. Users can log in with their Spotify account.

Once logged in, users can access their playlists, search for tracks, artists, and albums, and explore new music recommendations based on their listening history. The app uses the Spotify Web API to fetch and display data, allowing users to play songs, pause, skip, and adjust the volume.

The UI is responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring that the app is accessible and usable on various devices. The app's color scheme and styling are inspired by the Spotify brand, giving users a familiar and intuitive experience.

Overall, this project is an excellent example of how React and Context API can be used to build a robust, user-friendly app with authentication features. The project's codebase is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices, making it easy to understand and maintain.
